# Cody's 18652-FSE-Chat
18652 Pre-Registration Programming Assignment

A simple chat application built on Node.js, Express.js, Angluar.js, Bootstrap, SQLite and the usual suspects (HTML5/ES6/CSS3).

## Usage
To run the server simply open a command prompt or terminal in the project's root folder (on Windows shift-right-click in the window and click the "Open PowerShell window here"), then execute "npm start".

Once the server has started, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ (if on the host machine, otherwise use the server's IP address).

## Dev Notes
- Run `SET DEBUG=18652-FSE-Chat:* & npm run devstart` to enable automatic server restarts on file changes
